# Getting Started with the Project

In the project directory, you can run:

Create a file called `.env` inside the root of the project. Inside it should contain the following line:

`FAUNDB_SECRET_KEY="<insert-key-here>"`

Run the server with: `npm run start-server`

Run the client with: `npm run start-client`

This should automatically open the application in your default browser.
